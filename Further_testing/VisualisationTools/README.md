# MiniGrid Visualisation Tools

This directory contains tools for visualizing and analyzing the performance of reinforcement learning agents in MiniGrid environments.

## Available Tools

### PathVisualisation.py

Visualizes the path an agent took through a MiniGrid environment based on log files generated by the `performance_logging.py` script.

#### Usage

```bash
# Use the default log file (agent_run_log.json)
python PathVisualisation.py

# Specify a different log file
python PathVisualisation.py --log agent_run_log_empty.json

# Specify a custom output file name
python PathVisualisation.py --log agent_run_log.json --output custom_name.png

# Show help
python PathVisualisation.py --help
```

The script:
1. Reads the specified log file from the AgentTesting directory
2. Extracts agent positions and actions from the log
3. Creates a visualization of the environment and agent path
4. Saves the visualization to the `outputs` directory

#### Supported Log Formats

The script supports log files with two different key formats:
- "step X" format (produced by newer versions of `performance_logging.py`)
- "action X" format (produced by older versions)

## Output Directory

Visualizations are saved to the `outputs` directory within this folder. If this directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure your log file is a valid JSON file
2. Check that the log file contains position data for the agent
3. If you don't see any positions in the output, try a different log file
