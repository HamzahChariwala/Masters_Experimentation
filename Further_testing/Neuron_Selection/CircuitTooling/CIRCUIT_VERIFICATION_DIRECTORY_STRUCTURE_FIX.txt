CIRCUIT VERIFICATION DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FIX
================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document explains the issues encountered and fixes implemented for the circuit verification 
directory structure, specifically ensuring all four subfolders (results/, plots/, descriptions/, 
experiments/) are properly saved to circuit_verification/descending/ instead of being scattered 
across different locations.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
------------------
When running circuit verification experiments with the "descending" subfolder parameter, the 
system was not properly organizing all output files into a unified directory structure. 

SPECIFIC ISSUES:
1. Patching results were being saved to the default agent/patching_results/ directory instead 
   of circuit_verification/descending/results/
2. The analysis and visualization expected results in circuit_verification/descending/results/ 
   but couldn't find them
3. This caused a disconnect between where files were generated and where they were expected

AFFECTED FILES
--------------
1. Neuron_Selection/CircuitTooling/run_circuit_experiments.py
   - Main script for running circuit verification experiments
   - PROBLEM: Used default PatchingExperiment output directory (agent/patching_results/)
   - FIX: Override experiment.output_dir to point to circuit verification location

2. Neuron_Selection/PatchingTooling/patching_experiment.py (line 38)
   - Contains the PatchingExperiment class
   - ISSUE: Hardcodes output_dir = os.path.join(agent_path, "patching_results")
   - NOTE: This file was NOT modified to avoid breaking existing functionality

3. Neuron_Selection/CircuitTooling/visualize_circuit_results.py
   - Visualization script that looks for results in circuit_verification/descending/results/
   - No changes needed - was already looking in the correct location

4. Neuron_Selection/SelectionTooling/filter_metrics.py
   - Calls circuit verification functions
   - No changes needed - passes correct subfolder parameters

THE FIX IMPLEMENTED
------------------
In run_circuit_experiments.py, function run_experiments_from_file():

BEFORE (lines ~53-55):
```python
# Initialize patching experiment
experiment = PatchingExperiment(agent_path, device=device)

# Load patch configurations from file
```

AFTER (lines ~53-64):
```python
# Initialize patching experiment
experiment = PatchingExperiment(agent_path, device=device)

# Override the output directory for circuit verification
# Create experiment-specific output directory
exp_name = experiment_file.stem.replace('experiments_', '')
exp_output_dir = output_dir / exp_name
exp_output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Override the default output directory in the experiment
experiment.output_dir = str(exp_output_dir)

# Load patch configurations from file
```

WHY THIS FIX WORKS
-----------------
1. The PatchingExperiment class allows its output_dir to be overridden after initialization
2. By setting experiment.output_dir to the circuit verification location BEFORE running 
   experiments, all patching results get saved to the correct location
3. This doesn't break existing functionality because it only affects circuit verification 
   when using the descending subfolder structure
4. The fix is surgical and doesn't require hardcoding or changing core patching functionality

EXPECTED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
---------------------------
After running circuit verification with subfolder="descending/results", you should see:

Agent_Storage/[path]/circuit_verification/descending/
├── descriptions/
│   ├── coalitions_[metric1].json
│   ├── coalitions_[metric2].json
│   └── ...
├── experiments/
│   ├── experiments_[metric1].json
│   ├── experiments_[metric2].json
│   └── ...
├── results/
│   ├── [metric1]/
│   │   ├── denoising/
│   │   │   ├── [input1].json
│   │   │   ├── [input2].json
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── noising/
│   │       ├── [input1].json
│   │       ├── [input2].json
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── [metric2]/
│   └── experiment_summary.json
└── plots/
    ├── circuit_verification_[metric1].png
    ├── circuit_verification_[metric2].png
    └── ...

COMMAND SEQUENCE FOR FULL CIRCUIT VERIFICATION
----------------------------------------------
1. Run circuit experiments:
   python -m Neuron_Selection.CircuitTooling.run_circuit_experiments \
     --agent_path "path/to/agent" --subfolder "descending/results"

2. Run visualization:
   python -m Neuron_Selection.CircuitTooling.visualize_circuit_results \
     --agent_path "path/to/agent" --subfolder "descending"

POTENTIAL GOTCHAS FOR FUTURE
---------------------------
1. DO NOT modify the output_dir in PatchingExperiment.__init__() as this would break 
   all existing patching functionality throughout the codebase

2. The subfolder parameter must be handled carefully:
   - "descending/results" for the experiments (includes the results subdirectory)
   - "descending" for the visualization (points to the parent directory)

3. The fix only works when experiment.output_dir is set BEFORE calling 
   run_bidirectional_patching()

4. If you see results going to agent/patching_results/ instead of 
   circuit_verification/descending/results/, check that the output directory 
   override is happening correctly in run_experiments_from_file()

TESTING VERIFICATION
-------------------
To verify the fix is working:
1. Run circuit experiments and check that JSON files appear in:
   circuit_verification/descending/results/[metric]/[denoising|noising]/
2. NOT in:
   patching_results/[denoising|noising]/
3. Visualization should find the files and generate plots in:
   circuit_verification/descending/plots/

RELATED ISSUES RESOLVED
----------------------
- Input ID parsing issues (composite keys with commas were being split incorrectly)
- Analysis not finding JSON files (because they were in the wrong directory)
- Visualization failures (because results weren't in expected location)
- Disconnected workflow (experiments, analysis, and visualization weren't using same directories)
