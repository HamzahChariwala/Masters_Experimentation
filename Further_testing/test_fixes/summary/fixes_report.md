# Agent Evaluation System Fixes Report

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Environment Layout Mismatch
The layouts displayed in agent logs didn't match the corresponding Dijkstra logs for the same environment seed.

**Root Cause:** 
We found that the system was creating environments with different seeds than those specified in the agent's configuration file. The verification script demonstrated a significant layout mismatch with 18 out of 121 cells differing between agent logs and Dijkstra logs.

### Issue 2: Repeated MLP Input
The same MLP input was being reported for every state in the agent logs.

**Root Cause:** 
The agent logger was not actually running the agent model to predict actions on real observations from the environment. Instead, it was just recording initial inputs and then simulating a path.

### Issue 3: Incorrect Path Generation
Agent paths were all taking the same inefficient path, crossing lava, and never using diagonals.

**Root Cause:** 
The `_generate_simulated_path` method in `AgentLogger` was artificially creating paths instead of letting the agent model predict real paths. This was a fundamental design flaw that prevented accurate evaluation of agent behavior.

## Implemented Fixes

### Fix 1: Correct Environment Seed Handling
- Added a `check_environment_seed` function to ensure the right seed is used when creating environments
- Updated the environment creation process to respect the seed specified in the agent's config file
- This ensures the environment layout matches between agent evaluation and Dijkstra logs

### Fix 2 & 3: Real Agent Prediction and Path Generation
- Completely replaced the simulated path generation with real agent path generation
- Updated `_run_episode_from_state` to:
  - Get real MLP inputs for each state
  - Call the agent's predict method to get real actions
  - Step through the environment using those actions to generate a real path
  - Track actual rewards and episode outcome
- Added proper handling of action types including converting numpy array actions to integers

### Additional Improvements
1. Added robust environment position tracking with `_get_agent_position` method
2. Enhanced the MLP input extraction with proper error handling
3. Updated the main evaluation script to process either individual agents or directories of agents
4. Made the system more configurable with command-line arguments

## Verification
We've tested the fixes with the following approach:
1. Created detailed verification scripts to compare environment layouts
2. Built test scripts to check agent prediction and path generation
3. Implemented safeguards to ensure data is preserved when making changes

## Usage Instructions
The updated system can be run with:

```bash
python Agent_Evaluation/generate_evaluations.py --agent_dir <path_to_agent_dir> [options]
```

Options:
- `--env_id`: Environment ID (default: MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS11N5-v0)
- `--num_episodes`: Number of episodes to run per evaluation (default: 1)
- `--seed`: Default seed to use if not specified in config (default: 81102)
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed output

## Next Steps
1. Additional testing with more agent types and environment configurations
2. Performance optimization for large-scale evaluations
3. Integration with the full Dijkstra path comparison pipeline
